# It deployed, everything is green, and it does nothing

**Every check this tool and this platform run asks whether a CR is legal. None
asks whether it can do what it visibly intends to.** So a chart can render,
lint, pass CRD validation, pass the server-side dry run, apply, report `ok`, and
answer nothing - and the first sight of it is an agent telling a customer
something untrue, because a model handed silence does not report a failure. It
fills the silence.

This page is the way in for that symptom. It is by symptom rather than by CR
kind on purpose: the reader arriving here does not know which kind is at fault.

## The ones that have actually happened

| what you see | what it is | where |
|---|---|---|
| a tool returns nothing, and the agent answers from memory | processors present, `relationships` absent or partial, so only the entry's `handlingProcessor` runs | `../usecase/workflow-chain.md` |
| a value is set on the platform and the CR behaves as if it were empty | the key is declared under no release, so it is stored and never injected | `../usecase/conventions.md` |
| a capability that was working stops, with no change to it | the variable it read is still declared and set, and the thing that read it was replaced | this page, below |
| an agent has fewer skills than it should | a `searchPaths` entry names a parent directory, which resolves to nothing | `../usecase/skill-set.md` |
| the very first message on a new channel is never answered, and every message after it is | the entry routes into `listen-message` before anything replies, and reaching a `listen-message` ends the request | `../usecase/flow-agent-supervisor.md` |

## Why the toolchain does not catch these

Each layer answers a different question, and none of them is this one:

    helm lint                does every `.Values.*` a template reads have a default
    CRD validation           are the fields the right types, are required ones present
    server-side dry run      does the apiserver accept this object
    asgard-cli verify        do the references between CRs resolve
    the run                  did apply return

**"Accepted" and "doing something" are different claims**, and reading the first
as the second is what costs the hours. An engagement debugged two real bugs in a
tool's code - a misclassified 401, a wrong query parameter - before establishing
that the code had never executed at all. Both fixes were correct and neither was
reachable.

So when a shape does not work and every check is green, **the first question is
not what the code computes. It is whether it runs.**

## What does catch them

`asgard-cli verify` grew the graph checks for exactly this reason, and they are
the only ones here that ask about behaviour rather than legality:

- **W3** - a Workflow declaring several processors and no `relationships`. Only
  the entry's processor runs; the rest are dead. This is a failure, because
  there is no shape it is correct for.
- **the credential key check** - a `secretKeyRef` reading a key
  `.asgard-pipeline.yaml` declares for no release.
- **the placeholders step** - the generator's own TODOs still in the render,
  which is how a published Agent comes to show `TODO` as its sample questions.

**What still has no check is the third row of the table above**: a declaration
that was right when it was written and became dead when the shape around it
changed. Nothing sees drift, because nothing compares what is declared against
what the render reads. It is the one of the four that only a person notices,
and only by asking what still uses this.

**Checked:** 2026-09-14, from engagements' own reports and the failures
behind them - a tool whose HTTP call was never wired, a variable left declared
after the tool that read it was replaced, and a credential nobody could obtain.
The gate rules named above were written from those and each was held against
every reference deployment to confirm it reports none of them.

**Unchecked:** that these four are the whole list. They are the ones somebody
has walked into and written down; the shape of the failure - legal, accepted,
inert - has no upper bound on how many ways it can happen, and a fifth will
arrive the same way these did.
