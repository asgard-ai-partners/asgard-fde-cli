# Screenshots, and which situation each one is for

Every screenshot of this platform lives in the product documentation. There are
none in this binary and none in a customer repository, on purpose: an image
copied into an engagement goes stale without anyone noticing. This page records
which picture answers which question.

Both places serve the same file:

    https://docs.asgard-ai.com/img/docs/<path>          the published site
    <clone of asgard-docs>/static/img/docs/<path>       a checkout

The paths below are that `<path>`. The captions are the documentation's own alt
text, in zh-TW; the console itself is in English, so a deck in either
language can use them and write its own caption.

Open one before it goes on a slide. Nothing records when any of these was
captured, so a form that has since changed looks exactly like a current one, and
a stale screen shown to a customer who uses that screen daily is worse than no
picture.

Look for three things; the third is the one most often missed:

  - a credential - a hostname, an account, a connection string
  - another customer - a name, a logo, anything recognisable
  - our own implementation nouns, inside the picture. A CR name, a `ts-` /
    `sl-` / `dc-` / `ss-` prefix, an internal tool name, the admin console's own
    navigation. The `proposal-deck` skill bans these in the deck's text and the
    ban applies equally to a screenshot of them. Several images below contain
    them; they are marked, with what to crop

Every Odin capture carries the full console navigation down the left - Agent
Hub, MCP Servers, Skillsets, Plugins, Settings - so that crop applies to any
Odin screen bound for a proposal, not only the one marked below. Several
captures also carry the capture account's own name in a greeting or a settings
panel; those are marked too.

Cropping is normal and usually loses nothing: the part of the image that makes
the argument rarely contains the noun.

## For a proposal: what it looks like to use

Most proposals need this set and most decks leave it out in favour of the
console, which is our side, not theirs. These four follow one user's question to
a completed action, and they show the governance gate, which is hard to explain
in words.

| path | what it shows |
|---|---|
| `sindri-retail-stockout-transfer/00-available-agents.png` | the hub with five agents, before anything is asked. CROP FIRST: the greeting above the input names the capture account's user |
| `sindri-retail-stockout-transfer/01-allocation-answer.png` | a real answer: current state, available quantity, three options to choose from. The last line is the agent's raw `needs input:` prompt |
| `sindri-retail-stockout-transfer/02-approval-gate.png` | the approval dialog - the tool it wants to call, and nothing running until a person allows it. CROP FIRST: the dialog names `工具集:ts-wms` and `工具:create_transfer_order`. Keep the title line and the three buttons, drop the two rows between them - what the image has to show is that it stopped and asked, and that survives the crop |
| `sindri-retail-stockout-transfer/03-execution-result.png` | after approval: what was created, and the resulting stock forecast |

Give the third one its own slide whenever the requirement includes a write.
`../usecase/write-path.md` is the argument; this is the picture of it.

For a customer-service shape rather than an internal one:

| path | what it shows |
|---|---|
| `retail-ai-customer-service/21-flow-agent-canvas.png` | a single Entry node on an otherwise empty canvas. It does not show the default flow, whatever its caption says; use the next one for that |
| `retail-ai-customer-service/23-agent-node-open.png` | the Agent node's settings panel, with the flow behind it - Entry, Init, Agent and an Error push on Agent's failure branch are visible, the rest is under the panel - and the prompt deciding what a logged-out visitor is told versus a logged-in one, cut off at the right edge. CROP FIRST: the prompt names `prevPayload.user`, `customer-service-api` and `ecshop` |

And the one that shows Description used as routing text in the hub:

| path | what it shows |
|---|---|
| `sindri-home/home-available-agents.png` | each card's line is that agent's Description, as routing text |

## For a handover: the setup path

The order these belong in is [`setup-path.md`](../wiki/setup-path.md). Use them when the
audience is the people who will operate the thing - never in a proposal.

| step | path | what it shows |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `settings/data-source/data-source-create-provider-open.png` | the Provider list open: nine, all databases. This screen shows that an API key does not go here |
| 1 | `settings/data-source/data-source-create.png` | the form, with Test Connection before Save |
| 1 | `settings/connection/connection-create-options-open.png` | Connection types, grouped by syncer / For Loader / For Trigger |
| 2 | `mcp-servers/new-menu.png` | From Workflow against From Existing - the fork that decides how much work step 2 is |
| 2 | `mcp-servers/mcp-from-existing.png` | Transport Type, Command, Environment Variables - where an API key actually lives |
| 2 | `skillsets/new-menu.png` | From Scratch against From Git |
| 2 | `drive/drive-syncer-wizard-step1.png` | the five syncer sources: Google Drive, OneDrive, Git, Web Crawler, Data Source |
| 2 | `drive/drive-detail-context-index.png` | Context Index on an empty Drive, with the Enable Context Index button |
| 2 | `data-insight-semantic-model/table-setting-select.png` | picking tables, with live Data Preview. The preview rows carry company names, street addresses and phone numbers - demo data, but it reads as real; crop the preview before it goes anywhere outside the team |
| 2 | `data-insight-semantic-model/modeling-built.png` | ten tables modelled, one expanded to Description / Primary Key / Columns. The model is titled `capture-probe (not saved)`, and the assistant's summary on the right says Cube and artifact |
| 3 | `agent-hub-managed-agent/list.png` | the five built-in templates - show this when they think it starts from nothing |
| 3 | `agent-hub-managed-agent/create.png` | the one screen most handovers need: Alias, Description, and Prompt as Persona / Task / Context / Format, with the live preview |
| 3 | `agent-hub-managed-agent/resources-section.png` | mounting what step 2 produced |
| 5 | `agent-hub-flow-agent/create.png` | Name, Description, Advanced Sandbox Settings |

A worked example of step 3 filled in, rather than empty:

| path | what it shows |
|---|---|
| `retail-stockout-transfer/12-allocation-top.png` | a real agent's Alias, Description and four Prompt sections |
| `retail-stockout-transfer/13-allocation-resources.png` | its sample questions and everything it mounts |
| `retail-stockout-transfer/01-managed-agents.png` | five agents, all `Released` |

## For explaining a capability

| subject | path |
|---|---|
| the governance gate, as a list | `retail-stockout-transfer/04-automation-tools.png` - seven tools by name. Nothing on this screen shows that they are gated; the gate itself is `sindri-retail-stockout-transfer/02-approval-gate.png` |
| what a gated tool declares | `retail-stockout-transfer/11-transfer-order-tool.png` - its input schema |
| how many systems one agent reads | `retail-stockout-transfer/03-semantic-models.png` - CRM, ERP, e-commerce, POS, supplier, OLAP, WMS. CROP FIRST: the whole Odin console navigation is down the left - Agent Hub, MCP Servers, Skillsets, Plugins, Settings. Keep the card area only |
| conversational analysis | `mimir-thread/answer.png`, `mimir-thread/chart-result.png` |
| a dashboard that gets shared | `mimir-dashboard/share-dashboard.png` - the share dialog, over a dashboard that has no charts yet |
| teaching the model the business's own questions | `mimir-knowledge/add-question-sql-pair.png` |
| a Knowledge Base loading documents | `knowledge-base-knowledge/auto-load-form.png` |
| scheduled runs | `automation-trigger/new-trigger.png` - Schedule, Timezone, Model, Prompt |

## For a cost or governance conversation

| subject | path |
|---|---|
| what a bill looks like | `fehu/fehu-billing-reports-list.png`, `fehu/fehu-bill-detail-service.png`. The list carries a real-looking account's billing numbers and monthly amounts, and the detail names the workspace after a person's account; crop both to the column headers and one row |
| usage against quota | `fehu/fehu-quota-limits-top.png`, `fehu/fehu-usage-reports.png`. Both name implementation nouns as line items - Processors, Segments, Loaders, Indexer |
| who can reach which product | `console-product-permission/agent-hub-accounts.png`. CROP FIRST: the Manage Accounts in selector names a project that reads as a customer's name |
| workspace membership | `console-workspace-settings/workspace-accounts.png` |

Be careful with these four. Permissions and billing are where
a customer most easily reads a screenshot as a promise about what can be
restricted. The Console decides who manages a product or a resource; a call reaching
a deployed resource carries no user identity, so what one caller may touch is
decided in front of the platform, and no Console screen shows it -
`../wiki/console.md`. Do not put a permissions screenshot on a slide about
limiting access; it overstates what the platform restricts.

## The rest of what the documentation uses

The sections above are the curated set, grouped by the situation they answer. Below is everything else the documentation references,
so that "not in this page" does not mean "does not exist". They
are grouped by product rather than by situation, because nobody has worked out
which situation each one answers.

Every caption below is the documentation's own alt text. Each image has been
opened, and where the picture disagrees with its caption, or carries one of the
three things to check - a credential, another customer, our own implementation
nouns - the row says so after the caption. No capture date exists for any of
them, so a form that has since changed still looks exactly like a current one.

A caption saying a screen is empty is useful. Several read 空狀態 - the empty
state. Those are the wrong picture for a proposal, where the customer is trying
to imagine the thing full, and the right one for a handover, where somebody needs
to recognise the screen they are about to fill in.

The rest are reachable by path under `https://docs.asgard-ai.com/img/docs/`;
what is known about them is below, under `## What has no screenshot`.

## What has no screenshot

Not everything does, and assuming otherwise wastes a search:

  - the chart, the CRs, the cluster - there is no UI for any of it
  - LINE: three images. `integration/LINE` carries them hash-named rather
    than in a topic directory, which is why a survey of the topic folders
    misses them. Opened:

        /img/docs/60e2492a66bf.png    the prerequisites
        /img/docs/f3563b5553dc.png    the integration dialog, LINE selected,
                                      Channel Secret and Access Token fields
        /img/docs/7a4b3a60eb28.png    LINE's own Developers Console, the
                                      Webhook settings panel: Webhook URL,
                                      Verify, and the Use webhook toggle

    The third one is usable. It is LINE's console, not Asgard's, so Odin's
    redesign does not date it, and it carries a placeholder
    `https://example.com/webhook` rather than anyone's real endpoint. Use it to
    explain the half of the setup the customer does themselves: paste the Webhook URL we
    give them, press Verify, turn Use webhook on.

    The second one is the screen a customer would want to see. It is the old
    console - a left nav of Overview / Workflows / Knowledge / Environment /
    Apps, and a card dated 2024/09/20 - and today's Odin has none of those.
    [`integration.md`](../wiki/integration.md) already flags those pages as
    possibly stale for the same reason.

    So do not use the first two: a screenshot of a console the customer will
    not recognise is worse than no screenshot.

    Instead, describe the exchange
    in their words - "your customer types their order number in LINE, it replies
    with the repair status, and says so plainly when it cannot find it". Slide 5
    is an interaction, not a screen. A vendor's own documentation screenshot is
    not an option either: it is someone else's product surface in our proposal.

    A current capture of this screen is the most valuable missing screenshot -
    it is the channel a Taiwanese customer asks about first.

  - anything about handoff, pausing, or per-user counters, because the platform
    does not have them - see [`integration.md`](../wiki/integration.md)

## Sources

- Every path here was read off the `![alt](/img/docs/...)` references in
  asgard-docs' own `.mdx` pages, so a caption is the documentation's rather than
  a guess about what the file contains
  - asgard-docs `f00e0ee`

How the number is measured: the repository holds **679** `.png` files, but only **168** of
them are referenced by any documentation page - the rest are orphaned assets
from an older structure, and 204 of those sit under `user-guide/`, which no
longer has pages. So the denominator that means anything is 168, not 679.

This page names **116** of that 168. Every one of them resolves at `https://docs.asgard-ai.com/img/docs/<path>`, exists in the
repository, and is referenced by a live page, so nothing here points at a
missing file or at an orphan. Coverage is 69% of the images the documentation
uses.

That number moves whenever somebody adds an image to this page, and nobody
remembers to recount after such an edit, so it is computed by intersecting
the paths named here with the images a live page references at `f00e0ee`;
adding one moves the figure.

**The 52 not named here carry no alt text**, and most are hash-named files from
an older documentation structure. There is nothing useful to say about them
from a listing - the LINE three under `## What has no screenshot` are the
exception, and they were found by reading the page that uses them rather than by
listing files. If the picture you want is not here, read the docs page for
that feature; do not conclude the platform has no
screen for it.

**Checked:** every image this page names, opened at asgard-docs `21c920f6`
from asgard-docs `static/img/docs/`, and every caption held against the alt
text in asgard-docs `docs/` at the same commit.

**Unchecked:** whether each screen still matches the live console, which needs
a Console account nobody here has.
