# Fixed query tools

A `Toolset` of zero-parameter queries. The read path for a **public** audience.

**Seen in:** a public catalogue widget whose tools cover products,
categories, locations, recommendations and downloads.

**Checked:** 2026-09-02 against every tool in one Toolset - all of them carry a zero-parameter inputSchema - and the CRD.

**Unchecked:** the guidance on writing a tool description. Nothing mechanical checks whether it names the tool it could be confused with.

**Read the platform side first:** `../wiki/semantic-model.md` -
what a Semantic Model is, how it is built, and its limits. This page assumes you have.

## When this shape, and when not

Use it when the audience is **anonymous**. What can be asked is then decided by a
few statements in version control, no user input reaches SQL, and widening it
takes a CR change and a review.

Do **not** use it for an internal audience with open-ended questions - you will
end up writing a tool per question. A semantic layer is the right shape there.

The trade is deliberate: the agent can only answer what the queries return, and
that is the property being bought.

## The shape

    DataConnector  dc-<system>
      <- Workflow  wf-<tool>     one per tool, a query-database processor
      <- Toolset   ts-<name>     tools[] -> (workflow, entry)
           <- SandboxBlueprint.toolsetNames

One Workflow per tool, each with its own entry name. The Toolset points at
`(workflow, entry)` pairs.

## Generate it

    asgard-cli add querytool <name> --connector dc-<name> --toolset ts-<name>

That writes the structure below with the fields that fail silently already in
place - the display annotation, the labels the UI needs, the current field names.
**Copying the skeleton by hand is where those get lost**, because nothing tells
you they are missing: not helm lint, not CRD validation, not a server dry-run.

The generated file marks the judgement calls TODO. Those are what the rest of
this page is about.

## The skeleton

One Workflow per tool in `templates/tool/wf-<name>.yaml`, plus one Toolset in
`templates/toolset/ts-<name>.yaml`.

```

Put the reasoning - why this projection, which soft-delete filter, why a `COUNT`
is `DISTINCT` - in the file's header comment. There is nowhere else for it.

## Zero parameters is the whole point

Every tool takes **no arguments**, so no user input ever reaches SQL and the
injection surface is zero. `query-database`'s `sql` only accepts a static string
anyway; interpolating a keyword would re-open exactly the hole this shape closes.

A query that wants a keyword filter gets rewritten to aggregate instead. One that
filtered with `ILIKE '%keyword%'` became a `string_agg` returning one row per
product, and the agent picks from the result.

`requestConsent: false` on all of them - they are read-only.

## Do not ship two tools that differ only in projection

Two tools on the same FROM/JOIN differing only in which columns they return force
each one's `description` to name the other as the alternative - **and that is
exactly where a model picks wrong**.

Merge them, and make the difference a **column value** instead of a tool choice.
"Do I want the empty categories?" becomes `product_count = 0` rather than a
second tool. One deployment merged tools together this way, and recorded that
the merge also settled a real inconsistency: the two queries had used
different join types and different soft-delete filters, so they disagreed about
what existed.

## Designing the parts the generator leaves TODO

### Which queries become tools

Start from **what the audience actually asks**, not from what the database can
answer. For a public catalogue that is a short list: what do you sell, how are
they grouped, where are you, what fits my situation, where do I download the
spec. Five questions, five tools.

A useful test: **could a person answer this from one screen of the website?** If
yes it is probably a tool. If it needs judgement or comparison, it belongs to a
knowledge source instead.

Resist one tool per column. The set should be small enough that the model can
hold all of them, and each one distinct enough that choosing between them is
obvious.

### Writing `tooling.description`

The model picks a tool from this text alone, so it carries three things:

    <what it returns>, <how many rows>, and <when to reach for it>

    列出全部 10 個服務據點的名稱、地址、電話。
    客戶問「你們在哪裡有據點」「花蓮有沒有」「電話幾號」時用這支。

**Say the row count**, measured. It tells the model whether to expect a
complete list or a sample, and it tells the next reader whether the query still
does what it claims.

**Say what the tool does not do.** A zero-parameter tool returns everything and
the model filters afterwards - if that is not said, it will wait for a filter
parameter that does not exist, or call the tool repeatedly hoping for different
results.

**Say what an empty result means.** "No rows" is not "we do not sell it" unless
you say so, and the difference is a wrong answer to a customer either way.

## Fields that are not obvious

**`Toolset.spec.instruction` does not exist.** It was removed from the CRD. Tool
usage guidance lives in each tool's Workflow, in
`entries[].tooling.description`.

Do not add it back: **the CRD silently prunes it, `kubectl apply
--dry-run=server` reports success, and then helm's server-side apply fails the
deploy** with `field not declared in schema`. That cost a broken release once,
after passing every dry run.

**The 口徑 lives in the SQL now.** With no `instruction` field, anything a reader
needs to know - soft deletes, how a category path is built, why a `COUNT` is
`DISTINCT` - goes in the header comment of the tool's file.

**Measure the row counts and write them down.** A tool's description saying "89
products" sets the agent's expectations; a stale number is worse than none, so
note when it was measured.

**Every tool workflow needs the full workflow-set label set**, with
`workflow-set-type: automation_tool` - that is also what a Toolset's tool picker
filters on.

## Verify

```bash
# run each tool's SQL against the real database and record the row count
.venv/bin/python .agents/skills/db-query/scripts/query.py \
  --class <class> --prefix <PREFIX> -f tool.sql

asgard-cli gate               # every local check, the lint step included
asgard-cli verify <project>   # or one step alone, while iterating
```

**Never run `helm lint` by hand**: without the reserved `asgard` values file
that `gate` supplies, every chart that labels anything fails. `asgard-cli gate
--help` says why.

The xref check resolves every `(workflow, entry)` pair. **A wrong `entry` name is
as fatal as a wrong workflow name and apply catches neither**, so both halves are
checked.
