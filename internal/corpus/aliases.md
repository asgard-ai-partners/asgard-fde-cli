# The index: what a customer says, and what to search for

This is an index, not a page about the platform. It lives beside `wiki/`
rather than in it, next to `index.md`, because both are the wiki's own
bookkeeping. Inside the corpus it competed with the pages it points at: it lists
every alias, so it was often the one document carrying every term of a
translated query, and a search for 電商 returned this table instead of
`wiki/taiwan-channels.md`.

Apply both tables below to a query before searching. A term with a row here
does not match the material as the customer said it.

## How a row gets here

Every row is a term somebody searched for. Add one when a search came back
empty and the subject turned out to exist under another name; that is the only
test, and a row nobody has needed is a guess. File it with
`asgard-cli issue-report --new` as well, so every engagement gets it.

Point a row at a page where one page answers it: the pointer is checked by
`asgard-cli audit-material --links`, which a bare word would not be.

Every term in the right-hand column is one the material uses. Grep this
directory for a term before adding it: a row sending a reader to a word the
material does not use gives an empty search, and an empty search looks like a
subject nobody covered.

Use the term a page actually writes. A near-miss is worse than a dead term:
`audit` on its own lands mostly on this tool's own `audit-material`, so the row
says `audit event`, which is what the page says.

## What a customer says, in the words this material uses

The corpus is English and a customer conversation is not, so a query taken from
what somebody said finds nothing, and the reader concludes the subject is
missing when it is only named differently.

These replace the word. A Chinese term appears nowhere in an English corpus,
so keeping it in the query only adds a term that matches nothing.

## Names the material covers

Somebody searched the reference deployments for each of these and wrote down what
came back, so the row routes to a page that has the answer.

These are added to a query rather than replacing it, unlike the table above:
the name may be written verbatim in a page (SHOPLINE is), and that page is the
best answer. Replacing the name would lose it.

## Names it only routes

The material does not name these. The row exists because somebody searched
for it and the search was recorded; it routes to the shape the thing belongs to,
which is what this material has.

A row that routes looks the same as a row that answers, so a reader can take
results about a shape as results about a product. Move a row up to
`## Names the material covers` only when somebody has done the search and
recorded the answer.
