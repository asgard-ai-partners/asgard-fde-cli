// The processor contract, extracted from `ProcessorDefinitions` in asgard-core
// `internal/constants.go` with a go/ast walk on 2026-09-03, and cross-checked
// against the CRDs. `.agents/skills/asgard-platform/wiki/processors.md` is the
// prose version and carries the same table.
//
// **The read marker names asgard-core, which is where the definitions are.**
// It said asgard-kube, which is what the extraction was checked against and
// not what it came from - so the one upstream whose movement would invalidate
// this table was the one the marker did not name.
//
// Moved to `623ceb50` on 2026-09-11 after seven upstream commits, none of
// which touched the definitions: `ProcessorDefinitions` is lines 1390-2064 of
// `internal/constants.go` and every hunk in that diff starts at 645 or at
// 2097 and beyond. The table's source is byte-identical, so the marker moves
// without the table changing - which is the only case where that is honest.
//
// It is a pinned copy, and it is also **incomplete**: `await` is documented on
// `stream-llm-completion-message`, set in five production deployments, and
// declared in neither this file's source nor the CRD. So treat it as the set of
// keys the definitions know about, never as the set a chart may use.

// and Success only for `http-request`, while the documentation gives
// `http-request` a Failure branch producing `prevError` and four production
// charts route one. A table that is partly wrong invites the next rule to be
// built on the wrong part, which is exactly what happened here.

// Processors checks every Workflow's processors against the contract above.
//
//	W1  the type is one of the thirteen the CRD enum allows. A warning: the
//	    enum can gain a value, and a chart using a new one is right while this
//	    copy is stale.
//	W2  every required key with no default is set. **This fails.** A required
//	    key with no fallback is broken against every version of the platform,
//	    and the scaffold itself shipped a Workflow whose only LLM processor had
//	    no completionModel - it rendered, it verified, and it could not run.
//
// **There is no W3.** It was written - flag a key the contract does not declare
// on a processor that takes no arbitrary keys - and it fired on five of five
// production charts, every time for `await`. `await` is documented with real
// semantics on `stream-llm-completion-message` and set in five separate
// deployments, and it is in neither `ProcessorDefinitions` nor the CRD. So
// **the definitions are a subset of what the runtime accepts, not the config
// contract**, and a rule built on treating them as complete calls correct
// charts wrong. It was deleted rather than tuned: a checker that cries wolf
// teaches people to change what it can see rather than what is wrong, which
// this material has already caused once.
//
// The counterpart to W2 is what it deliberately does not check: a required key
// that *does* have a default is left alone, because omitting it is legal. That
// is where `semanticLayer.allowWrite` lives, defaulting to true, and no gate can
// tell a deliberate omission from a forgotten one - which is why the templates
// write it out explicitly instead.
