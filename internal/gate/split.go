// AgentSplit checks the "one system, one Agent" split.

// None of these break helm lint or apply. They make the orchestrator route
// wrongly, or let an agent's search space grow back:
//
//	R1b  an Agent cannot have no capability at all - a layer, a Toolset or a
//	     SkillSet, at least one - so that deleting one by accident does not pass
//	     quietly. **SkillSet was missing from that list and the rule was wrong
//	     about a running deployment**: every subagent of a flow-agent supervisor
//	     mounts skills and nothing else, and nine of them were told they had no
//	     capability at all.
//	R4   no Agent sets allowedCubes, which keeps the standing decision that a
//	     bound layer is queryable in full.
//	R7   a published Agent has at least two sampleQuestions. Published is the
//	     agent-published label, and that label is the only gate on whether a
//	     caller includes the Agent in agent_hub.agent_names.
//	R11  a SemanticLayer that no Agent binds is reported. An observation, not a
//	     verdict: the render cannot tell "deliberately unbound" from "somebody
//	     has not finished the read path", and neither can this tool.
//	R13  no Agent lists the same semantic layer twice in its own semanticLayers.
//	     A duplicate entry has no reading in which it was meant: the second one
//	     grants nothing the first did not, and it is what a copied line looks
//	     like when the name inside it was not changed.
//
// The numbering is inherited from the requirements document that first wrote
// these rules down for one deployment, which is why it has gaps; R13 is new
// here and continues it rather than reusing a retired number.
//
//	R1 is gone. It refused an Agent that bound more than one semantic layer, and
//	an Agent that bound a layer some other Agent had already bound. **Neither
//	half is enforced by anything else in the chain**: the CRD declares
//	`semanticLayers` as a plain array with no maxItems, and the platform's own
//	rule list checks that each name resolves to a real SemanticLayer and nothing
//	more. Run over a 12-industry demo chart set - agents modelled one per
//	business role, roles sharing the systems they read the way they do in a
//	company - it produced 121 failures across 11 of its 12 charts, and every one
//	of them was the shape somebody meant. The first half at least had a
//	rationale in the material (an agent mounting two layers has the search space
//	the split exists to shrink - `internal/corpus/usecase/agent-hub.md`); the
//	second half had none anywhere. **That rationale is still the advice and it
//	is not a verdict a render can reach**, so it stays in the extract and is not
//	a rule here. What survives of R1 is R13, which is the half of "bound twice"
//	that can only be a mistake.
//	R10 is gone. It refused an Agent binding a layer recorded as "OLAP-only" in
//	`.asgard-config.json`, and the recording was done by a flag on `verify`. **A rule
//	that needs a per-customer exemption list to work is not a rule.** It also
//	wrote a product use case - Data Insight, read through Mimir - into a config
//	field of a tool that cannot know what a customer is building. See
//	asgard-odin-pm docs/decisions/2026-09-05-asgard-cli-config-surface.md.
//	R12 is gone. It required prompt.task and prompt.format to be byte-identical
//	across every Agent in one render, on the premise - measured at the time, on
//	the deployments there were - that those two fields are wholly a shared
//	scaffold and the specialisation lives in persona and context. **A chart set
//	that interleaves instead breaks the premise**: one agent per business role,
//	writing task and format as a shared skeleton with the role's own substance
//	inside it. On that shape the rule was simultaneously always-red and blind -
//	22 failures across 11 of 12 charts that no edit could clear short of
//	redesigning 64 prompts, and an edit to a genuinely shared line in one agent
//	would not have changed the output, which was already failing.
//
//	**Nothing replaced it, and the reason is that the replacement was tried.**
//	The obvious one is to compare only the lines every Agent shares and report
//	drift in those. Measured on the same 12 charts, "a line present in every
//	Agent but one" hits 14 times, and all 14 are deliberate: a read-only role
//	whose capability line says (read) where the others say (read + write). A
//	rule cannot tell that from a copy somebody edited in one place, so there is
//	no version of this check that does not cry wolf on a correct chart.
//
//	It was also not applying where it was supposed to. Subagents of a flow-agent
//	supervisor are excluded, and the exclusion reads SandboxBlueprint
//	`spec.agents.value` - a reference deployment declares its five subagents
//	through `spec.agents.expression` instead, so all five counted as hub Agents
//	and R12 failed that deployment too. Finding that the exemption silently did
//	not apply to the shape it was written for is the other half of why this is a
//	deletion rather than a repair.
//
//	`internal/corpus/usecase/agent-hub.md` keeps the advice - copy a shared
//	block whole, and change every copy in one edit - as advice.
//
// Zero Agents is legal and passes: a pure Flow Agent project keeps its prompt in
// a Workflow and its capability in a SandboxBlueprint, so its chart has no Agent
// CR at all. The summary says "0 agent(s)" so that a project that lost its
// Agents by accident is visible to a reviewer.
//
// Every check here is per Agent, so none of them needs to know which Agents are
// a supervisor's subagents. The helper that read that out of a SandboxBlueprint
// existed for R12 and went with it.
