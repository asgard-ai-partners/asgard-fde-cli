# Open questions

Questions that block or shape a decision, and are not answered yet. This is
the first file to read when picking this repo up, and the first to update when
an answer arrives.

An unanswered question has no other place in this repo. A decision record is
for something settled. A task spec's open questions are no longer read once the
task reaches `done`. The living spec describes what is true now. Without this
file, the next person rediscovers the question, usually after making the wrong
assumption.

`asgard-cli question` reads this file and reports anything still open.

## How to use it

- Add a row as soon as a question blocks or shapes a decision.
  If you can already answer it, answer it instead of adding a row.
- Say who can answer it, in this row, so someone follows it up.
  The name is who we chase, not something the customer is shown.
- When it is answered: move the row to Answered with the date, write a
  `docs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` if it settled anything, and apply the
  delta to the living spec. Do not delete the row: that it was once open
  explains why the design has the shape it has.
- Numbers never change. Retire a row in place instead of renumbering, and
  leave the gap. Once anything cites a question by number - a deck, a meeting
  note, the prose under this table - renumbering breaks every reference.
- When you build a deck, update this file in the same edit. Questions that are
  reworded, retired or discovered while building one go back into these rows.
  `asgard-cli question` prints this file before anything else, so a stale row
  is what the next person reads first, and it still shows a judgement that has
  since been overturned.
- Do not park a question here to avoid asking it. If the customer can answer
  it in the next meeting, put it on the agenda.

## Two filters, before a question becomes a row

A long table of questions usually just copies the customer's document. Most
questions are removed by one of these two filters.

1. Is this ours to answer at all? Apply this one first; it removes the most. We
deliver an agent; we do not design the customer's operation. The test is whether
the answer changes what we build. What we need from them is ours to chase - a
credential, an endpoint, a network path, a document, an account. How they staff a
channel, who maintains a document, how their own two systems relate to each other
is theirs: hand it back as a note before go-live, do not track it as a row. Doing
their integration analysis produces a table nobody uses.

2. What is the smallest thing that proves what the customer said they are
testing? This is not the smallest thing that is easy to build. If they gave you
a verification list, a first delivery that skips the item they most want to see
has failed. Find the smallest slice that reaches the hardest
item on their list. What that slice does not need is not an open question: it is
a line in the request's "out of scope", with a note of what has to be answered
before it comes back.

Cut mechanisms, not capabilities. Dropping "we will not read
your system yet" fails the test, because that is the thing being judged. Dropping
"for now the user tells us which record they mean" does not - a lookup keyed on
something the user types proves the same integration as one keyed on a recognised
identity. The hardest question in an engagement usually does not block the first
delivery; do not file it as a blocker.

What is left after both filters is usually three or four rows - what blocks the
minimum itself, anything the customer must do before we can proceed, and anywhere
two of their answers contradict each other.

`.agents/skills/asgard-platform/guide/requirements.md` carries both filters in full, with a
worked example.

## Questions the platform itself does not answer

Some questions are not about this customer at all - they are things the Asgard
platform's own documentation does not settle, and every engagement hits the same
ones. Those live in the tool, not in this file, so that an answer reaches every
engagement at once:

    `.agents/skills/asgard-platform/wiki/platform-unknowns.md`

Read that list before assuming the platform can or cannot do something. When one
of those questions blocks this engagement, add a row above naming it, and when
the platform team answers it, tell whoever maintains `asgard-cli` so the next
engagement starts with the answer.

## What the customer asked us

The customer's questions to us. A customer's own document usually ends with a
list of things they want us to confirm. Each one needs a written reply by a date.

Check each against `.agents/skills/asgard-platform/wiki/platform-unknowns.md` first. Several will be
on it, because customers ask about the same things every engagement hits - what
a given user may reach, what gets logged and for how long. When one matches, say
so: "no confirmed answer yet, we are checking with the platform team" is a valid
answer. Do not answer from an assumption: that puts something we cannot do into
their acceptance criteria, and they usually judge the delivery by this list.

Answer in writing, with a date, next to the question.

These answers go back to the customer, so load
`.agents/skills/plain-chinese/SKILL.md` before writing them - no 不僅……更是……,
no sentence that ends by announcing its own importance, no 至關重要 or 賦能 or
無縫銜接. The customer reads these answers closely. Keep them short, and write
"we are checking" as a plain sentence without adjectives around it.
