description: The customer sent a document. File it with provenance, then read it into questions.
argument-hint: "<path to the file>"
---

File it:

```bash
asgard-cli reference add $1 \
  --what "<what it is, in your words - not its file name>" \
  --from "<who supplied it; a role outlives a person>" \
  --dated "<the document's own date, not today>"
```

Fill all three in now. Only the person who handed it over knows these, and they
may not be available later. `--dated` is what tells a reader whether the
material is stale; a customer's own documentation gives no sign of its age.

The document is copied byte-identical and never rewritten - the provenance goes
in `references/_index.md` - so when they send a second version you can diff it
against the filed one.

Then read it. `asgard-cli check` warns about material in `references/` with no
question and no request against it, because the interview is what turns a
document into a requirement.

```bash
asgard-cli question add "<what the document left open>" --ask "<who>"
`.agents/skills/asgard-platform/guide/requirements.md`
```

Their document usually ends with a list of things they want us to confirm.
Each needs a written reply by a date; `docs/open-questions.md` has a table for
them.
