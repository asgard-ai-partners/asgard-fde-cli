They said: $ARGUMENTS

Work out which of these it is. It is usually the first, and the first is the one
most often skipped.

1. It left something open: anything you cannot build without knowing. File it
now, with who can answer, so that somebody follows it up:

```bash
asgard-cli question add "<the question>" --ask "<who can answer>"
```

Before writing it, check it against `.agents/skills/asgard-platform/wiki/platform-unknowns.md`. Several
of the things customers ask are things the platform has no answer for, and
"there is no confirmed answer yet, we are checking" is a valid answer. Do not
answer from an assumption: that puts something we cannot do into their
acceptance criteria.

2. It is a thing they want that the agent cannot do today. That is a request,
and it comes after the interview, not before, because the interview decides
nearly every section of it:

```bash
asgard-cli request add "<what they want>"
```

3. It settled how something gets built. That is a decision record. Write down
why the rejected option was rejected; nobody can reconstruct that later:

```bash
asgard-cli decision add "<the topic>" --module <the living spec module>
```

4. It is domain knowledge the running agent will need - what a status code
means, how two systems' ids correspond, what to say when something is missing.
That is not a question and not a reference document. It belongs in
`assets/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`, because only a skill is synced into the
platform. Left in `references/` it is invisible to the running agent, and the
agent will look as if it is ignoring what it was told.
