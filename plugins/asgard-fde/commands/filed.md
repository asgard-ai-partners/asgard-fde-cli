description: The customer sent a document. File it with provenance, then read it into questions.
argument-hint: "<path to the file>"

File it:

```bash
asgard-cli reference add $1 \
  --what "<what it is, in your words - not its file name>" \
  --from "<who supplied it; a role outlives a person>" \
  --dated "<the document's own date, not today>"
```

**Fill all three in now.** Whoever handed it over is the only person who knows,
and they stop being available at about the point somebody needs to know.
`--dated` is the one that decides whether the material is stale: a customer's own
documentation reads exactly the same whether it is current or four years old.

The document is copied byte-identical and never rewritten - the provenance goes
in `references/_index.md` - so when they send a second version you can diff it
against the filed one.

**Then read it.** Filing is not reading, and `asgard-cli check` will say so:
material in `references/` with no question and no request against it is a
warning, because the interview is what turns a document into a requirement.

```bash
asgard-cli question add "<what the document left open>" --ask "<who>"
`.agents/skills/asgard-platform/guide/requirements.md`
```

Their document usually ends with a list of things they want *us* to confirm.
Those are not open questions about the engagement - they are obligations with a
reply date, and `docs/open-questions.md` has a table for them.
